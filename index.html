                        This is the Intergalactic Federation. We hope your
                        mission is going smoothly and that you have not made any
                        unprofessional connections during your stay on

                        Your former team was trying to deliver to you the map
                        of an ancient treasure that has been buried on Earth for
                        eons, but they were unfortunately hit by a meteor, and
                        the map broke into pieces and scattered.

                        In the case of some disaster such as this, in which the
                        map made it into the hands of someone other than
                        yourself, the instructions were divided up and
                        safeguarded through riddles that only you could
                        solve.

                        We were able to locate all the pieces, but in order to
                        reconstruct the map and determine the location of the
                        treasure, you’re going to have to solve the riddles as
                        only you could do. Good luck. We’re counting on
                        you.
